# OrCAD-WeinBridgeOscillator
OrCAD project of a Wein bridge oscillator. I successfully implemented this project I had initially designed and simulated in OrCAD

This project was made in year 3 of my university studies at Politehnica University of Bucharest @ Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology

The implementation was a bit rushed and unorganized and some of the documentation is in Romanian so browse at your own risk!
